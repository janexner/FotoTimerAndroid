[Foto Timer for Android](https://www.jan-exner.de/software/android/fototimer) is a free, open source app that can count and beep. It helps with repeating tasks, such as at the gym. People also use it for developing analogue film, or for meditating.

Foto Timer is working with "processes", which define how Foto Timer counts, and how often it beeps. Processes can also be "chained" together, meaning that a process can automatically launch another. There is almost no limit to how complex your timers can be.
